    Automatically creates and positions multiple cameras with keyframe animations
    for standard cinematic sequences. Useful for:
    - Conversations (shot-reverse-shot)
    - Establishing shots (wide → medium → close-up)
    - Product showcases (orbit)
    - Dramatic reveals (push-in)

    Args:
        sequence_type: Type of sequence to create. Options:
            - "establishing-medium-closeup": Three cameras at different distances
              (wide → medium → close-up). Frames divided equally into thirds.
            - "shot-reverse-shot": Two cameras for conversation, alternating between
              over-shoulder angles. Requires 2 characters. Frames split 50/50.
            - "orbit": Single camera orbiting 360° around subject with keyframe animation.
            - "push-in": Single camera dollying from wide shot to close-up with smooth animation.

        characters: List of character labels (1-2 depending on sequence).
            First character is primary subject. Second character used for shot-reverse-shot.

        duration: Total duration in frames (default: 120 frames = 4 seconds at 30fps).

        # - Warm romantic lighting (2 spot lights)
        # - Wide shot camera
        # - Over-shoulder camera (for conversation)

    What Gets Created:
        1. **Lighting**: Scene-appropriate lighting setup (spot lights)
           - Dining: Warm romantic or standard dining lights
           - Interview: Professional three-point lighting
           - Portrait: Classic three-point portrait lighting
           - Conversation: Natural conversational lighting
           - Environment mode set to "Scene Only" (disables dome)

        2. **Character Positioning**: Logical positioning for scene type
           - Dining: Facing across table distance
           - Interview: Facing each other at interview distance
           - Conversation: Facing at conversation distance (closer than interview)

        3. **Cameras**: Multiple camera angles appropriate for scene
           - Wide shots for establishing
           - Medium shots for general coverage
           - Close-ups for portraits
           - Over-shoulder for conversations

        4. **Suggestions**: Actionable next steps for scene enhancement

    Notes:
        - Requires characters to be already loaded in scene
        - Creates new cameras and lights (doesn't delete existing)
        - Scene type detection is keyword-based (simple matching)
        - Generic fallback if no template matches
        - Props are not automatically loaded (suggested in suggestions list)
        - All positioning uses world-space coordinates
        - Lighting intensities calibrated for Iray rendering

    Limitations:
        - Does not load props automatically (manual loading required)
        - Does not apply poses or emotions (use daz_set_emotion separately)
        - Simple keyword matching (not full NL understanding)
        - Limited to pre-defined scene templates
        - Works best with 1-2 characters

    Follow-up Actions:
        After scene generation, you can:
        - Load props manually with daz_load_file()
        - Apply character emotions with daz_set_emotion()
        - Fine-tune lighting with daz_set_property()
        - Adjust camera positions with daz_set_property()

    Notes:
        - Each character is processed sequentially; the full batch may take a
          few seconds for scenes with many morphs
        - Per-character errors do not abort the batch — check results for notFound
        - Combine with daz_animate_conversation for expression-timed dialogue scenes
        - Use baseline_frame in daz_time_expression to clear previous expressions
          before a beat (daz_sync_character_beats does not set baselines)
